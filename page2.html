          <h4><li>Audi R10 TDI </li></h4>
          <p>For bringing diesel power to racing.When a top Audi exec first heard the R10 he thought something was terribly wrong. In fact its diesel engine was so quiet, the sound he heard was actually the tyres slapping the road. Since its 2006 debut and up until Porsche returned to La Sarthe, only diesels have won Le Mans.</p>
