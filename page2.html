          <li>Audi R10 TDI </li>
          <p>For bringing diesel power to racing.</p>
          <p>When a top Audi exec first heard the R10 he thought something was terribly wrong. In fact its diesel engine was so quiet, the sound he heard was actually the tyres slapping the road. Since its 2006 debut and up until Porsche returned to La Sarthe, only diesels have won Le Mans.</p>

          <p>Was a 253mph road car really necessary? Of course not. You could ask similar questions of the moon landings, or of the Taj Mahal. But this wasn’t about meeting a practical demand - it was about mankind showing off to the universe. And it worked.</P>

          <p>After Enzo blocked a deal for Ford to buy Ferrari, Henry Ford II ordered his racing division to build a car that could destroy the Italians at Le Mans. In 1966 he got his wish, when three GT40s crossed the line in flying formation… in first, second and third.</p>

          <p>When the T43 finished the 1958 Argentine GP - with Stirling Moss in charge - it became the first ever mid-engined car to win an F1 race. It might have had the physical presence of a housefly, but it was the inspiration for the cars we have today.</p><table>
