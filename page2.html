          <li>Audi R10 TDI </li>
          <p>For bringing diesel power to racing.</p>
          <p>When a top Audi exec first heard the R10 he thought something was terribly wrong. In fact its diesel engine was so quiet, the sound he heard was actually the tyres slapping the road. Since its 2006 debut and up until Porsche returned to La Sarthe, only diesels have won Le Mans.</p>

          <li>Bugatti Veyron</li>
          <p>For being the Concorde of cars.</p>
          <p>Was a 253mph road car really necessary? Of course not. You could ask similar questions of the moon landings, or of the Taj Mahal. But this wasnâ€™t about meeting a practical demand - it was about mankind showing off to the universe. And it worked.</P>
